# Little Taco Shop Project

## About this Project
In [Dave Gray's HTML Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA), his final chapter is the overall project of the course. Taking everything we've learned and create a mock website of a Taco shop. Thanks to him for teaching HTML and making me hungry as I work.
